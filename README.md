# Conduction-Gel
Repository for the Conduction Gel project, made originally for Shaft 06

## Warning: This code as well as assets are provided as is, meaning that errors won't likely be fixed.
You can though, make pull requests to fix issues, or report them. I might sometimes check to see if everything's working.

## Disclamers:
1. This isn't a proper implementation, it was supposed to be a placeholder for when the new scripting engine in P2CE gets introduced. This means that although it works very well (I'd say), expect that sometimes a bug can happen here or there.
2. This relies on Reflection Gel, meaning that the conduction gel will behave exactly like reflection gel e.g. reflecting lasers. And this also means you cannot use reflection gel in the same map!
3. Provided in this repository is a UCP made for BEE2 version 43. However, it won't work in Portal 2. This gel needs P2CE as it uses P2CE-specific vscript functions. That UCP is meant to be used with my [Puzzlemaker Export Script](https://github.com/TheEnderek0/PuzzleExporter).

# What is the ***CONDUCTION GEL***
Simply put - a gel that conducts electricity. You can use it to link two things together which are Emitter and Catcher.
- An *Emitter* is what excites the gel and makes it energetic. It can receive inputs to turn on and off.
- A *Catcher* is what outputs the gel's electricity. It has on/off outputs that turn on if the gel connected to it is excited.

Besides that it also kills turrets when energized (doesn't affect players).

# Well cool and all but how do I use it?
